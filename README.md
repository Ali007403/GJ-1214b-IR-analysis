# SNR Enhancement Pipeline for IR Exoplanet Spectroscopy

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a preliminary pipeline for SNR enhancement in infrared (IR) exoplanet spectroscopy using Gaussian fitting and multi-band stacking, as described in the RNAAS note "A Preliminary Technique for SNR Enhancement in Infrared Exoplanet Spectroscopy via Spectral Decomposition".

The pipeline processes FITS files from JWST/HST, performs data inspection, and includes synthetic demonstrations. It is implemented in Python and runs in Google Colab.

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+ (tested in Colab)
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `astropy`, `scipy` (pre-installed in Colab; no additional pip installs needed beyond the notebook's code)

### Usage
1. Open `GJ_1214b_Testing (1).ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run cells sequentially to load FITS data, inspect HDUs, and simulate processing (e.g., Rayleigh scattering for demonstrationâ€”adapt for IR focus).
3. Customize paths to your FITS files as needed.

### Key Features
- Loads and inspects JWST/HST FITS files (e.g., i2d, x1dints formats).
- Demonstrates data preprocessing and synthetic SNR enhancement.
- Efficient for low-SNR IR datasets; computational time <1 minute for typical inputs.

### Limitations
- Synthetic examples only; real data validation recommended.
- Assumes standard FITS formats; adapt for custom datasets.
